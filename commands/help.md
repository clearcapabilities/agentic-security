🆕 NEXT-GEN (v3) — production-aware + adversary-grade
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The v3 PRD additions. These read .agentic-security/last-scan.json — run /scan first.

  Production-aware filters (compose with any /scan mode)
    /scan --exposed-only            Only findings prod controls don't already block
    /scan --mitigated-only          Inverse — findings your WAF/auth/network handles
    /scan --persona apt-nation-state    Filter by attacker class

  Attacker-grade output
    /threat-model              Auto-derived STRIDE — assets, boundaries, findings
    /personas                  Per-persona priority matrix (5 adversary classes)
    /playbook                  Copy-paste attack scripts (curl / Nuclei / multi-step)
    /bounty                    Predicted HackerOne / Immunefi USD payouts
    /adversary --finding <id> --target <url>    Multi-step LLM exploit agent

  Defensive-posture views
    /spof                      Single-point-of-failure controls (counterfactual)
    /trust-boundary            Auto-Mermaid architecture diagram with findings
    /scan --concurrency        Data races, missed unlocks, deadlock cycles
    /scan --spec-drift         Function name vs. body intent-drift detector

  Engineering / forensics
    /archaeology --finding <id>      When did our codebase first become vulnerable?
    /why-fired --finding <id>        Full provenance graph for one finding
    /diff-scan --baseline <bin> --candidate <bin>     FR-SDLC-10 scanner-vs-scanner
    /self-test                 Adversarial self-test — scanner attacks itself

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🤝 BOTH LANES USE THESE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Dependency depth
    /supply-chain-check        Roll-up verdict across six dep audits
    /dep-pinning               Loose ranges (^, ~, *) allowing silent injection
    /dep-freshness             Score how stale your direct deps are
    /install-script-audit      postinstall / preinstall hooks
    /vendor-audit              Copy-pasted third-party code (invisible to SCA)
    /trim-dependencies         Installed but never imported
    /dep-alternatives          Lighter / safer replacements

  Project meta
    /status                    Plugin & project health snapshot
    /help                      This command
    /find-and-fix-everything   The "I have 10 min" mode

USAGE NOTES
  - Every command works as /agentic-security:<name> too (the long form).
  - Most commands accept a [path] argument to limit scope.
  - First run /scan once. Most other commands read its output
    from .agentic-security/last-scan.json.
  - PostToolUse hook scans every Edit/Write automatically. Throttled per-file
    to one scan / 5s.
  - Set AGENTIC_SECURITY_OFFLINE=1 to skip all outbound calls (OSV, EPSS, KEV).

WHERE THINGS LIVE
  Project state:  .agentic-security/last-scan.json, rules.yml, license-policy.yml
  CVE cache:      ~/.claude/agentic-security/osv-cache/  (24h–7d TTL)
  Plugin bundle:  ~/.claude/plugins/cache/clearcapabilities/agentic-security/
