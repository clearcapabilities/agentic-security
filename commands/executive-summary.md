description: One-page CISO-facing summary of the six harness controls — what runs, what's blocked, what's caught, what's proven, what fails safely, what's compliance-ready.
argument-hint: "[--output PATH] [--format text|md]"
---

Print a detailed plain-English executive summary of the harness controls in
this project. Audience: a CISO who has fifteen minutes, no familiarity with
this codebase, and needs to know whether to trust an AI agent working in it.

No CWE numbers. No CVSS. Six numbered sections. Each section has four named
subsections (modeled on `/explain`):

  • What it does — the control, in plain English
  • Specifically — the concrete list of allows/blocks/intercepts
  • What would have to go wrong — the threat model in one paragraph
  • Live status (this project) — verifiable indicators from current state

## Notes for downstream use

- **Default format is plain text** with ANSI color for terminal reading.
  `--format md` switches to GitHub-flavored markdown. `--output PATH`
  implies `--format md` and writes to that path (typical: `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`).
- **Live evidence.** The "Live status (this project)" subsection of each
  control is derived from current state — hooks wired, scan signed, audit
  log entry count, remote witness configured, compliance artifacts present.
  A CISO is reading the *current* posture, not a generic template.
- **The four subsections per control** are deliberate, modeled on
  `/explain`'s plain-English narrative shape:
  - **What it does** — the control in 2–3 sentences of plain English.
  - **Specifically** — the concrete enumerated list of allows / blocks /
    intercepts. This is where a reviewer who wants to verify "yes the
    harness actually rejects `rm -rf /`" finds the proof.
  - **What would have to go wrong** — the threat model in one paragraph.
    Honest about what the control does NOT cover.
  - **Live status** — verifiable indicators a reviewer can re-derive.
- **No CWE numbers, no CVSS, no security jargon in the narrative prose.**
  The "Specifically" block names the actual file paths, commands, and
  patterns — those are necessarily concrete — but the connective tissue
  is written for an executive reader.
- **What it is not.** This is the controls report. It is not the
  findings report (`/scan --all`), the grade (`/report-card`), or the
  compliance attestation (`/compliance-report`). Those exist; this one
  lives upstream of them — "should the CISO trust the agent at all."
